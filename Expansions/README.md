** On its way **

* MINIC2N

For the v5.3 board, a 9V system PSU and tape adapter to allow for the use of a Commodore C2N datasettes including both the C1530 and C1531 a well as 3.5mm Mic and Ear tape jacks for traditional cassette records and a header for an original CPC464 tape player as previously removed for v5. This works surprisingly well. Thanks to @PeepoUK for the idea.

** Untested and Unsorted **

* MINIUSIFACII

A USIFACII interface, though due to the chip shortage, this never got tested.
