# CPC464-2MINIRS232C v2

A CPC464-2MINI version of the original Amstrad RS232C adapter modified with an updated line driver / receiver and 9 pin D-Sub. Needs an original or Honeysoft Commstar ROM to operate.

# Main points 

* It uses an Z80 DART not the SIO/2
* The line driver / receiver is a MAX208 or compatible
* There was an original version with the original line driver and receiver which needs a voltage level converter which I may upload if needed. It's just easier to use the MAX208 version instead.
* More information to follow.
