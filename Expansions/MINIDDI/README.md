# MINIDDI

3.5" Disk and Gotek Interface using the 765 disk controller and Epson SED.

# Main points 

* Based on the DDI-1 with modifications for the Epson SED (as found in the 6128).
* This works with standard 3.5" PC Drives, and Goteks having borrowed slight changes from the PPC640.
* Adapter in the Extras folder for use with 3" drives.
* This hasn't really changed since the first release since it works so well. Might need a tidy up.
* More information to follow
